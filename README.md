# WWDC22

## Introduction

Accepted in WWDC22 Swift Student Challenge. This is an app dedicated to my grandfather.

In short, Grandpa's Farm is an app in which you can browse what to grow on a specific dateüìÜ -- in a very coolüòé coverflow-styled carousel, create growth reminders automatically‚è∞, and take an overview of what you grewüìù. It is an app dedicated to my grandfather.

When I was a child, my grandfather had a little farm in our front yard. He grew a lot of crops in it, such as scallions, tomatoes and even sunflowers. Those memories of growing plants, sculpting clay, building snowmen and scents from steaming traditional herbs are the best parts of my childhood impressions. Later, he moved to the city with my family. At the age of 78, he still has a healthy body and a young mind. Last year, to keep himself busy, he rented a small yard and continued his old hobby, growing plants! I was very happy when I heard it, and then I came up with an idea of making an app for his iPad to help him organize plant information and keep track of his crops through growing states.
	
I respect my grandfather a lot, because not only did he take care of me when I was little, but he also taught me the importance of learning. Born and raised in a farmer's family in a rural village in China, he was the first to get into the high school in the county town. In an age when few people seriously consider women's education in China, he sent two daughters to universities for higher education. Even though it was not his responsibility, he always supported my education and ideas. If not for him, I would not have been here studying my favorite major and pursuing my dream.

## How to experience

Build with and run on Swift Playgrounds 4.0.2 on iPadOS 15.4

## Future plan

* Enrich farm management function, use calendar API to add notification and more
* Make the very-cool-coverflow-styled-carousel more easy to use as a component and open source it
